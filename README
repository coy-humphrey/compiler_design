The goal of this project was to create a compiler. It involved learning to use tools such as flex, and bison for regular expressions and context free grammars respectively. It also involved generating and processing an abstract syntax tree to type check programs and to generate code.

The code can be found in the code directory. To create an executable, just run make. Flex and bison are required to compile the program. All testing was done on a 64 bit linux installation. It's possible, but unlikely that this program will work in a non-unix environment.

To run, run the executable with the code you would like to compile as an argument. For example: oc 01-hello.oc

Example programs can be found in the example_programs directory. The script ocl will compile a .oil file generated by the compiler into an executable. For example: ocl 01-hello

The pdfs in this directory contain the instructions we were given for the assignment.
